**What is an off-market property?**

An off-market property is one that is for sale, however, is not publicly advertised. Sellers list off-market property on Homefound for various reasons. Primary reasons include: testing the market, selling discreetly, and reducing advertising costs.

**What is the difference between pre-market and off-market?**

A pre-market property is a type of off-market property, whereby, the seller seeks market interest prior to initiating a public advertising campaign (i.e. on realestate.com.au, or domain). Pre-market advertising would include cold calling buyers, or listing on Homefound.

**How reliable are your off-market properties?**

We engage in multiple practices that allow us to maintain a high off-market standard:

1. **Restrict access:** Access to our listings is granted to paying members only.
2. **Off-market purging:** We run continuous automated checks to detect when our properties have been listed on REA or Domain. Any matches will be purged from our off-market database.
3. **Strict policies:** Agents must use Homefound as their first round of advertising. If an agent does not abide by our policy, will remove them  from the platform.

**What do you mean by primary listing sites?**

We use the term to inclusively refer to [Realestate.com.au](http://realestate.com.au) and [Domain.com.au](http://domain.com.au).

**How does Homefound help me find good deals?**

Off-market properties naturally sell at discounted prices due to reduced levels of buyer demand.
