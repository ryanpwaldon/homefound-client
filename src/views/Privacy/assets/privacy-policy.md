This policy also explains your choices surrounding how we use your personal information, which include how you can object to certain uses of the information and how you can access and update certain information.

## 1. Personal Information we collect

We collect personal information when you provide it to us, when you use our Services, and when other sources provide it to us, as further described below.

**A. Information You Provide to Us**

**Account Creation:** When you create an account or otherwise use the Services, we may collect information such as your name, email address, password, work address, licence numbers, and your phone number.

**Your Communications with Us:** We collect personal information from you such as email address, phone number, or mailing address when you request information about our Services, register for our newsletter, request customer or technical support, or otherwise communicate with us. We also collect the contents of messages or attachments that you may send to us, as well as other information you choose to provide, and that may be associated with your communications.

**Payment Information:** When you choose to subscribe to our Services, we will collect payment information allowing you to pay us. We use third-party payment providers to process payments on the Services. We may receive information associated with your payment information, such as billing address and transaction information, but we do not directly store payment information on the Services.

**Surveys:** We may contact you to participate in surveys. If you decide to participate, you may be asked to provide certain information which may include personal information.

**Interactive Features:** We may offer interactive features such as forums, blogs, chat and messaging services, and social media pages. We and others who use our Services may collect the information you submit or make available through these interactive features. Any content you provide via the public sections of these features will be considered "public" and is not subject to the privacy protections referenced herein. By using these interactive features, you understand that the personal information provided by you may be viewed and used by third parties for their own purposes.

**Registration for Sweepstakes or Contests:** We may run sweepstakes and contests. Contact information you provide may be used to inform you about the sweepstakes or contest and for other promotional, marketing and business purposes.

**Conferences, Trade Shows, and Other Events:** We may attend conferences, trade shows, and other events where we collect personal information from individuals who interact with or express an interest in the Services.

**Business Development and Strategic Partnerships:** We may collect personal information from individuals and third parties to assess and pursue potential business opportunities.

**Job Applications**. We may post job openings and opportunities on the Services. If you reply to one of these postings by submitting your application, CV and/or cover letter to us, we will collect and use your information to assess your qualifications.

**B. Information Collected Automatically**

**Automatic Data Collection:** We keep track of certain information about you when you visit and interact with any of our Services. This information may include your Internet protocol (IP) address, user settings, MAC address, cookie identifiers, mobile carrier, mobile advertising and other unique identifiers, details about your browser, operating system or device, location information (including inferred location based off of your IP address), Internet service provider, pages that you visit before, during and after using the Services, information about the links you click, information about how you interact with the Services, including the frequency and duration of your activities, and other information about how you use the Services. Information we collect may be associated with accounts and other devices.

**Cookies, Pixel Tags/Web Beacons, and Analytics Information:** We, as well as third parties that provide content, advertising, or other functionality on the Services, may use cookies, pixel tags, local storage, and other technologies ("Technologies") to automatically collect information through the Services. Technologies are essentially small data files placed on your devices that allow us and our partners to record certain pieces of information whenever you visit or interact with our Services.

- **Cookies:** Cookies are small text files placed in device browsers to store their preferences. Most browsers allow you to block and delete cookies. However, if you do that, the Services may not work properly.
- **Pixel Tags/Web Beacons:** A pixel tag (also known as a web beacon) is a piece of code embedded in the Services that collects information about engagement on the Services. The use of a pixel tag allows us to record, for example, that a user has visited a particular web page or clicked on a particular advertisement. We may also include web beacons in e-mails to understand whether messages have been opened, acted on, or forwarded.

**Analytics:** We may also use third-party service providers to collect and process analytics and other information on our Services. These third-party service providers may use cookies, pixel tags, web beacons or other storage technology to collect and store analytics and other information. They have their own privacy policies addressing how they use the analytics and other information and we do not have access to, nor control over, third partiesâ€™ use of cookies or other tracking technologies.

**C. Information from Other Sources**

We may obtain information about you from other sources, including through third-party services and organisations. For example, if you access our Services through a third-party application, such as a social networking site or a third-party login service, we may collect information about you from that third party that you have made available via your privacy settings.
