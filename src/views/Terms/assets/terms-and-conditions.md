For purposes of these Terms, "you" and "your" means you as the user of the Service.

Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned upon your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who wish to access or use the Service.

By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms, then you do not have permission to access the Service.

## 1. Content

**Definitions:** For purposes of these Terms: (i) **"Content"** means text, graphics, images, music, software, audio, video, works of authorship of any kind, and information or other materials that are posted, generated, provided or otherwise made available through the Service; and (ii) **"User Content"** means any Content that account holders (including you) provide to be made available through the Service.

**Our Content Ownership:** **We do not claim any ownership rights in any User Content** and nothing in these Terms will be deemed to restrict any rights that you may have to use and exploit your User Content. Subject to the foregoing, Homefound and its licensors exclusively own all right, title and interest in and to the Service and Content (excluding User Content), including all associated intellectual property rights. You acknowledge that the Service and Content are protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of the United States and foreign countries. You agree not to remove, alter or obscure any copyright, trademark, service mark or other proprietary rights notices incorporated in or accompanying the Service or Content.

**Rights in User Content Granted by You:** By making any User Content available through the Service, you hereby grant to Homefound a non-exclusive, transferable, worldwide, royalty-free license, with the right to sublicense, to use, host, cache, store, reproduce, transmit, publicly display, publicly perform, publish, distribute and modify (for formatting purposes only), your User Content solely in connection with operating and providing the Service and Content to you and, depending on the permission you grant, to other users. Subject to the foregoing license, as between Homefound and you, you retain any and all of your rights to your User Content.

**Your Responsibility for User Content:** You are solely responsible for all your User Content. You represent and warrant that you own all your User Content or you have all rights that are necessary to grant us the license rights in your User Content under these Terms. You also represent and warrant that neither your User Content, nor your use and provision of your User Content to be made available through the Service, nor any use of your User Content by Homefound on or through the Service will infringe, misappropriate or violate a third party’s intellectual property rights, or rights of publicity or privacy, or result in the violation of any applicable law or regulation.

**Sharing User Content:** You may designate your User Content as "public" or "private". You agree that User Content you designate as public will be accessible by and be available to other users of the Service to whom you grant access to such publicly designated User Content. Consequently, you understand and agree that such users will have the right to view your publicly designated User Content. If you grant users additional permissions with respect to your User Content, you understand and agree that such users will, depending on the permissions you grant, have the right to use, publish, display, modify, or duplicate such User Content.

**Monitoring Content:** Although we’re not obligated to monitor access to or use of the Service or Content or to review or edit any Content, we have the right to do so for the purpose of operating the Service, to ensure compliance with these Terms and to comply with applicable law or other legal requirements. We reserve the right, but are not obligated, to remove or disable access to any Content, including User Content, at any time and without notice, including, but not limited to, if we, at our sole discretion, consider any Content to be objectionable or in violation of these Terms. We have the right to investigate violations of these Terms or conduct that affects the Services. We may also consult and cooperate with law enforcement authorities to prosecute users who violate the law.

## 2. Subscriptions

Some parts of the Service are made available on a paid subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). Pricing for the Subscriptions is set forth here: [https://homefound.net.au/pricing](https://homefound.net.au/pricing).

You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing Cycles are set on a monthly or yearly basis. Whether you are using monthly or yearly billing, your account may be charged on a monthly basis.

Auto-Renewal: You agree that at the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew and your payment method for such Subscription will automatically be charged at the start of each new Subscription period for the fees and taxes applicable to that Billing Cycle, under the same conditions as the prior Billing Cycle unless you cancel it or Homefound cancels it.

A valid payment method, including credit card, is required to process the payment for your Subscription. You must provide Homefound with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorise Homefound to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.

Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, Homefound may attempt to charge the credit card on file one or more times. Should payment continue to fail, the Subscription will be cancelled.

You may cancel your Subscription either through your online account management page or by contacting Homefound customer support team at [team@homefound.net.au](mailto:team@homefound.net.au).

## 3. Referrals and Credit

Your account with the Service can accrue credits in a variety of ways ("Account Credits"), for example by referring new users to the Service ("Referral Program"). Account Credits can only be used to offset your Service’s Subscription fees.

**Referral Program**. You can earn Account Credits by inviting new users to the Service. You will be assigned a personal referral link for referring such new users that can be found at the Earn Credit tab in your account settings page ("Personal Referral Link"). To participate in the Referral Program, you may refer new users who have not previously opened an account on the Service by sending them your Personal Referral Link via email, by tweeting your Personal Referral Link, or by copying your Personal Referral Link and sending it yourself. When a new user signs up and opens a Service account via your Personal Referral Link, both you and the new user will receive Account Credits redeemable to offset Subscription fees.

You and your referred new user will receive the Account Credits amount specified on our Pricing page at the time of the referral. The Account Credits will be credited to your respective Service accounts after your referred new user signs up and opens a Service account via your Personal Referral Link. The maximum total of Account Credits you may receive under the Referral Program is $200.00 ("Account Credit Limit"). Once the Account Credit Limit has been reached, you will no longer receive any Account Credits for referrals. For Account Credits to apply, you must have a paid Subscription or first upgrade to a paid Subscription. If you already have a paid Subscription, you may apply Account Credits to the next payment due in your Billing Cycle. If you are upgrading to a paid Subscription, Account Credits may be applied to your new paid Subscription.

To qualify for Account Credits via the Referral Program, the referred new user must (i) be a new Service user that has never created an account on the Service before, (ii) use a Personal Referral Link to sign up for a new Service account. Referring new Service users may not collect referrals by:

- self-referring by using multiple or false names, identities, accounts or email addresses;
- referring anyone who is an existing Service user, including an existing user with an account under an alternate email address;
- using spam or sending unsolicited emails to persons they don’t personally know to collect referrals, or otherwise violating any applicable law, rule, regulation or third party terms of use;
- posting on message boards, public forums, coupon sites or other online venues (such as coupon websites, reddit, or Wikipedia);
- permitting another individual to use the referring user’s account;
- referring fake people to the Service, impersonating another person, or otherwise providing Homefound with false or misleading information;
- using the Personal Referral Link in any manner that is disparaging or that otherwise portrays Homefound or the Service in a negative light; or
- any other restriction we impose on participants in our Referral Program in our discretion upon prior notice.

By acquiring Account Credits, you agree and acknowledge that we are granting you a limited, revocable license to a digital item, and that the Account Credits are not your personal property. Except as explicitly provided herein, your Personal Referral Link and Account Credits are non-transferable. Account Credits cannot be applied to previous purchases and are not redeemable for cash. All Account Credits are voided immediately upon termination of our Referral Program. We reserve the right to suspend or cancel accounts or remove Account Credits in our sole discretion if we notice any activity that we believe is abusive or fraudulent.

## 4. Free Trial

Homefound may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a free trial for a limited period of time ("Free Trial"). If you are on a Free Trial, you may cancel at any time until the last day of your Free Trial by following the cancellation procedures outlined in the Subscription section of these Terms. If you or Homefound cancel your Free Trial, you acknowledge and agree that we may delete all of your User Content or data associated with the Workspace that was assigned to your Free Trial. If you do not cancel your Free Trial, then your Free Trial will be converted to a paid Subscription at the end of the trial period, and you hereby authorise us to charge your credit card or other payment method for continued use of the paid Service under such Subscription. You may then however, cancel your Subscription in accordance with the Subscription section of these Terms.

At any time and without notice, Homefound reserves the right to (a) modify the terms and conditions of any Free Trial offer, (b) cancel any Free Trial offer, or (c) cancel any Free Trial subscription at any time.

## 5. Fees and Fee Changes

Homefound, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.

Homefound will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.

Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.

Fees are stated exclusive of any taxes or similar governmental assessments of any nature, including, for example, value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes, assessable by any jurisdiction (collectively, "Taxes"). You will be responsible for paying all Taxes associated with your Subscription, except for those taxes based on our net income. Should any payment for the Service be subject to withholding tax by any government, you will reimburse us for such withholding tax.

## 6. Refunds

Payment obligations are non-cancelable, and fees paid are non-refundable and there are no credits for partially used Subscription periods.

Certain refund requests for Subscriptions may be considered by Homefound on a case-by-case basis and granted in sole discretion of Homefound.

## 7. Communications from Homefound

By creating an account on our Service, you agree to subscribe to newsletters or marketing materials and other promotional information we may send. However, you may opt out of receiving any, or all, of these marketing communications from us by following the unsubscribe link or instructions provided in any email we send.
